## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/vimukthiwi/turtle-crossing-game.git
    ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:
    ```bash
    cd turtle-crossing-game
    ```

3. Ensure you have Python installed (preferably 3.7+).

4. Install the required dependencies:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

## Usage

To start the game, run:
```bash
python main.py
```

Use the `Up` arrow key to move the turtle up. The goal is to reach the top of the screen without getting hit by a car.

## Game Mechanics

- The player controls a turtle that moves upwards when the `Up` arrow key is pressed.
- Cars move from the right side of the screen to the left.
- If the turtle collides with a car, the game ends.
- Each time the turtle reaches the top, the level increases, and the cars move faster.

## Classes

### Player
Handles the player (turtle) movement and checks if the player has reached the finish line.

### CarManager
Manages car creation, movement, and speed adjustments.

### Scoreboard
Manages the score display, updates, and game over message.

### Example File Structure

Ensure your project directory has the following structure for the README instructions to work properly:

```
turtle-crossing-game/
│
├── player.py
├── car_manager.py
├── scoreboard.py
├── main.py
├── requirements.txt
└── README.md
```

### Notes

1. Replace `yourusername` in the `git clone` URL with your actual GitHub username.
2. Add a `requirements.txt` file if there are any additional dependencies. If the only dependency is Turtle, it might not be necessary to have one, as Turtle is included in the standard library for Python.

This `README.md` should provide a good starting point for users to understand, install, and run your Turtle Crossing game.
